# System-Analyses-and-Design-Documents

This project focused on developing a system for DriverPass. They wanted something that would help students pass their DMV tests by giving them better ways to study and practice. The system needed to let students take online classes, do practice exams, and schedule their driving lessons. It also had to provide secretaries and administrators with the tools to manage users, appointments, and other aspects of the system.

One thing I feel I did well was keeping everything organized. I made sure all the diagrams connected back to what the client needed. I think the class diagram turned out especially solid and clearly showed how all the pieces fit together. I also explained the technical parts in a way that someone without a tech background could still understand.

If I had more time, I would probably clean up the sequence diagram just a bit more. It works, but I think it could look even better with a few adjustments. I also would want to figure out a better way to connect with the DMV automatically instead of assuming someone would always enter updates by hand.

To figure out what the client really needed, I went through the interview and paid attention to what they were asking for. Things like progress tracking, user roles, scheduling lessons, and linking drivers and cars stood out. I made sure those pieces showed up clearly in my diagrams and that the system could grow if they added new features later.

When I design something like this, I start simple. I figure out what the users need to do and then build from there. For this project, I used diagrams to help me picture how it would all come together. That really helped me stay focused and make sure I wasn’t just adding features that didn’t matter. I plan to keep using that approach in the future.
